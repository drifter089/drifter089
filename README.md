## 👁️ About Me  
I’m not just another developer in the infinite multiverse. I’m **The Developer**.  
Why waste time contributing to predictable forks when I can rewrite the system itself?  
Here, you’ll find tools, scripts, and frameworks that break boundaries—and sometimes rules.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, Rust, and the occasional binary where necessary.  
- **Frameworks:** React (for the weak), Next.js (for the bold), and Snakemake (because I code with strategy).  
- **Philosophy:** Write code that doesn't just execute—it dominates.  

---

## 🧠 Core Directives  
1. Build projects that disrupt, confuse, and eventually **control**.  
2. Refactor reality, not just functions.  
3. Commit, push, and let chaos sync.

## 💡 Notable Projects  
- 🕶️ **RealityChecker.js**  
  A library for spotting vulnerabilities in multiverse constructs (and your code).  
- 🤖 **InfiniteCrawler**  
  Automates API data mining across parallel dimensions.

## 🎯 Mission  
You think open-source is about freedom? **Wrong.**  
I open-source for power—because true control comes from rewriting the rules.
